            <p>John-Billy band started March 2018 were five young legendary men met together in Ålesund, with a common hatered towards bad music that was flourishing in their society.
            So we decided we were going to be the ones to revamp the modern dance-tekno music genre. We will not give up on our dream to finally dominate the music industry and make people finally enjoy proper tunes in their life.
